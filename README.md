**PhD in Physics | Material Science | Waste-to-Wealth Research | Energy Storage Systems**

This repository summarizes my research and coding background.

## About Me
I completed my PhD on the synthesis of carbon nanostructures from waste plastics and their applications in solid-state supercapacitors. My work integrates:
- Carbon nanomaterials (CNTs, graphene, etc.)
- Electrochemical characterization
- Solid-state ion transport studies
- Python-based data analysis and visualization
- Green and cost-effective synthesis protocols

## Technical Skills
- **Python Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, ASE, pymatgen, Qiskit
- **Research Tools:** VASP, Origin, ImageJ, LaTeX
- **Focus Areas:** Waste-to-wealth, solid-state supercapacitors, DFT simulations

More content (notebooks, scripts, data workflows) will be added soon.
